# Pong-Game-in-Python
This is a simple Pong game built using Python's `turtle` module.   The project is structured using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles and includes:  - Ball movement with bounce logic - Paddle controls - Collision detection - Scoring system - Game reset on out-of-bounds

## ðŸ’¥ Challenges I Faced

### 1. Turtle graphics not working in PyCharm (macOS)
At first, I was frustrated because when I ran my `turtle` code in PyCharm,  
only a tiny black window appeared â€” and nothing happened.

**What was the problem?**
PyCharm (on macOS) sometimes doesnâ€™t render `turtle` graphics properly, especially if you're using an internal terminal or the wrong Python interpreter.

**How I fixed it:**
- Switched to running the script in **Thonny IDE**, which works perfectly with turtle graphics
- Or ran it directly from terminal using `python3 main.py`
- Made sure I was using the correct version of Python (not a broken `virtualenv`)

### 2. PyCharm virtual environment errors (Permission Denied)
I also had problems setting up the Python interpreter in PyCharm.  
It gave me errors like: ```bash "virtualenv: error: argument dest: the destination is not writable".

************************************************************************************************************************************************************
During the days when even my closest friends stopped believing in me,  
I made a quiet decision: to learn programming.

This repository â€” this journey â€” is part of that challenge.  
Not just to prove something to themâ€¦ but to myself.  
That I can still grow. That I can still rebuild.

Maybe by sharing it, I'll get better.  
Maybe one day, someone else will read this and realize â€” they can too.
